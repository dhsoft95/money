                                <p>The following are reasons why we are collecting information:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>To verify your identity.</li>

                                    <li>To collect payment for your transactions.</li>
                                    <li>To send transaction SMS/email alerts to you and the recipient of your money.</li>
                                    <li>To send you marketing & promotional details, service updates.</li>
                                    <li>To analyze our business operations.</li>
                                    <li>To provide you with information about the Service.</li>
                                    <li>To comply with applicable laws, regulations, and rules, such as those relating to “know-your-customer”, anti-money laundering, and counter-terrorist financing.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>In general, we are required to collect personal data including any “know-your-customer” information, verification of your identity and transaction records, and communications with you in order to comply with our legal obligations. In order to fulfill our contract with you and provide the Service we will process your personal data and relevant third-party data to process your transactions, and collect payment for your use of the Service. The same applies in relation to competitions and campaigns, we will process the personal data of the participants and the winners to fulfill our part of the contract.</p>
                                <p>As long as you are a customer we believe that it is in your interest to receive occasional information about the Service and we may therefore send you marketing notices, service updates, and promotional offers that we believe are relevant for you based on your previous use of the Service. For the same reason, we may also process your data to analyze our business operations in order to improve the Service. In situations where you give us specific consent to process certain kinds of personal data, you are able to withdraw that consent at any time. We will then stop processing such data and, if no other legal ground for keeping your personal data apply, we will also erase your data from our system.</p>
